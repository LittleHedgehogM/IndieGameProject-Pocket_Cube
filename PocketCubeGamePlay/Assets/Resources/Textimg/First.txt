Hinc itur ad astra
The inorganic life born this way
 
Life succession and civilization endures
Carbon-based life introduced sillicon-based life
The intellegence oriented from the mathematical origin
Explorates knowledge left by predecessors
Finite arithmetic power goes toward 
Vast expanse space and time
