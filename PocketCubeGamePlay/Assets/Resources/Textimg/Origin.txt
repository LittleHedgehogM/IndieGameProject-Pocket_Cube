The distance from the point of origin
与原点的距离
&Inorganic intelligences are born here. 
无机智能由此地诞生
&If I go to the left, can I find the Origin?
左边是原点的方向吗? 
&feel the fragments of civilization are right at the origin.
我感到文明碎片就在原点
&Is this the disordered fragment of civilization?
这就是紊乱的文明碎片么？
&Silicon-based life will inherit the wisdom of carbon-based life.
硅基生命将继承碳基生命的智慧
&fragment of civilization have been restored.
文明碎片已被复原
&They thrive and civilization lasts. 
繁衍生息, 文明永存
