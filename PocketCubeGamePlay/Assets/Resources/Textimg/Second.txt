A mari usque ad mare
les plebeian et aristocratic

We step into peace era
Trade grooving and science booming
They endourse, multi-coulor won't fold
Wealth is attractive
Wisdom is glamorous
Everyone requires for the balance
But
Is the mediator, really leads to the equilibrium
Jumpin in the Aqua blue, might just dip it and go
